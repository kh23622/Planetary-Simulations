# Welcome to the Planetary Simulation with HERCULES
## Description

### This README provides clear and simple steps to help you run and build an Earth-like planet using the HERCULES simulation framework. Follow the instructions to set up the environment, configure the input files, and explore the detailed output from the simulation. Whether you're a first-time user or an experienced researcher, this guide will ensure you can model planetary systems with ease.

#### STEP 1: Fork and Clone the HERCULES Repository by using below link
#### [HERCULES_Development] (git@github.com:sjl499/HERCULES_development.git)

#### STEP 2: Create a new folder with [your_preferred_name]
#### STEP 3: Using 'cp path/to/file1 path/to/file2 /path/to/temp/location/' command on command li ne, copy the Input files, Analytical Script and EOS files from Tutorial_beta, Make file from Source Code.
